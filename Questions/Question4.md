## Question:

Write MATLAB code to generate a stem plot for the discrete signal \( y[n] \), where \( n = -5:15 \) and \( y[n] \) is defined as:

\[ y[n] = \begin{cases} 2 & \text{if } n = 3 \\ 1 & \text{if } n = 0, 5, 10 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \]

Ensure the plot includes appropriate title, x-axis label, y-axis label, grid lines, and customized appearance for the stem markers.
